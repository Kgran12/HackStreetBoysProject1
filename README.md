## Description

For this challenge created the Javascript code for a random password generator.

## Solutions/Notes

- Our project was to create a simple work out app that displays weight for 4 different lifts.
- We created a form to enter in all the information and it is displayed on a table on our second page.
- We used Framework Foundation in place of bootstrap, and used it for our table on the results page.
- we created a logo for our app and stylized the page so it was on brand.
- Our two data apis were a youtube search api that searches for exercise and lifting videos as well as an exercise database api to display various exercises.
- Our code uses javascript to take the max's from the first page and displays them on the results page so the user knows what weight they shoudl be lifting. The maxs are stored in local storage and then displayed on the results page.
